This tutorial is a step-by-step guide that shows you how to build a standalone ESP8266 Web Server that controls two outputs (two LEDs). This ESP8266 Web Server is mobile responsive and it can be accessed with any device that as a browser in your local network.
1. Download and install the Arduino IDE on your operating system (some older versions won’t work).

2. Then, you need to install the ESP8266 add-on for the Arduino IDE.  For that, go to File > Preferences.

3. Enter http://arduino.esp8266.com/stable/package_esp8266com_index.json into the “Additional Board Manager URLs” field as shown in the figure below. Then, click the “OK” button.
4. Go to Tools > Board > Boards Manager…
5. Scroll down, select the ESP8266 board menu and install “esp8266 platform”, as shown in the figure below.
6. Go to Tools > Board and choose your ESP8266 board. Then, re-open your Arduino IDE.
